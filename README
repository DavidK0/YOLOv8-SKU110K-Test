# SKU110K YOLOv8 Test #
In this repositoy I attempt to apply a YOLOv8 model on the SKU110K dataset. The purpose of this is to demonstrate my ability to proficiency in applying deep learning algorithms to real-world computer vision problems.

# Prepare_SKU110K.py #
This script loads the SKU110k dataset and prepares it for input to YOLOv8. 500 images each for training/validation/testing are selected at random. The prepared dataset is put in a folder called SKU500.
