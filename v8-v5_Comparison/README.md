# v8-v5 Comparison #
In this section I perform a comparison between two version of YOLO by Ultralytics, version five and version eight, with regard to their inference performance.

# Setup #
I trained a total of three models:
* YOLOv8 nano
* YOLOv5 nono
* YOLOv5 small
I trained all three models for 130(?) epochs with the same or similar hyperparameters. The best model from each train run was saved and used for the comparison. The data used SKU500, the subset of SKU110K that I used for initially taining YOLOv8.

# Results #
|Model|mAP50|speed(min)|
|-----|-----|----------|
|yolov8 n| |
|yolov5 n| |
|yolov5 s| |
